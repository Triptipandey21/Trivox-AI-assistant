## 🔊 About Me

I'm passionate about building **AI-driven** and **voice-based applications** that simplify everyday tasks. My current project, **Trivox Voice Assistant System**, is a smart contact manager that lets users interact through **natural voice commands**, enabling hands-free calling, searching, and contact management. It's powered by technologies like **speech recognition**, **voice authentication**, and **cloud services**.
